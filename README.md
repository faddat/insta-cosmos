### The compose file of your dreams
More validation, more sentries, faster and cheaper.  Designed for use at the edge of the network on carefully built hardware, as well as on hetzner.de's ax61-nvme server and equivalents.  Requires a fast CPU, stable RAM, and ample nvme storage.  

Purpose built for the construction of inter-blockchain functionality, even on chains with no IBC support. 

Yep, it can all run on a single fast machine.
